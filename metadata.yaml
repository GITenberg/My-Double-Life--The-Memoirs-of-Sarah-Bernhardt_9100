description: 'My Double Life is the autobiography of the French actress Sarah Bernhardt,
  who was internationally famed during her lifetime and afterwards as one of the classical
  theater''s all-time greatest stars. Bernhardt''s memoirs are composed with a novelist''s
  (or actress''s) sense of artistry and suspense that leaves no doubt of the charisma
  for which she was famed in her "double life," both on- and offstage. Yet at the
  same time as this book very consciously contributes to the crafting of her image,
  it also illuminates a whole era: not only the world of theater, but also the worlds
  of women, politics, society, Europe and America, and, indeed, of history making
  itself.'
